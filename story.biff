  A wrought-iron gate stands closed before you, its bars twisted into leafy vines. To the left, a mossy path leads toward a marble fountain.

  The gate yawns open on rusty hinges. Beyond, the garden’s secrets lie bathed in dappled sunlight.

You enter a hidden grove where flowers glow softly in the shade.

  The water you drank earlier still tingles with magic, and the blossoms lean toward you.

  The petals are still, waiting.

You cradle the petals—they pulse with life in your hand. You feel the garden’s heartbeat anew.
